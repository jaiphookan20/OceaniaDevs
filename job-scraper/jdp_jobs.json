    "description": "To begin with - if you’re unaware of what a Candidate Manager does? It is effectively looking for and speaking to all the amazing Digital Talent Brisbane has to offer.\nEssentially, your new role will be to find people utilising a multitude of tools to-hand, qualify these individuals and flag their details to the consultant/s in the team - with the ultimate aim of successfully finding people what some may define as career-defining opportunities.\n\nWe help connect talent with fantastic work opportunities’ within the digital arena*\n  \nBrief back-story on why we're hiring:\n\nWe're weeing a distinct trend across the digital communities we focus on delivering to. We require another person to join the team to help bolster our delivery capabilities. \nWhat does this mean? Well some people sit in the Candidate Manager’s role for 12-24 months (and thoroughly enjoy doing so), whilst some people pick it up quickly and get promoted is less than 6 months - it genuinely depends on the individual, and that’s completely fine.\n\nAt JDP we pride ourselves on letting people work as adults, we do not have KPI's, work a hybrid WFH scenario once probation complete, and we DO NOT micromanage. As different as we all are, we share the same drive and passion for doing the right things.\nWe are a team; we work collaboratively, and the results speak for themselves.\n\nFor anyone that is new we provide training. This is done one-one and also as a wider group, but the result is that you are never left alone or unsure of what to do, and this is how we continue to build on our success.\n\n\nThe attributes we'd love you to have are:\n\nA natural ability to build rapport with complete strangers\nA great memory or at least the ability to further train this aspect\nAn excellent phone manner\nLevels of tenacity that would see you continuously strive to assist others\nThe ability to have fun\nDrive – huge amounts of drive\nEnjoy network events (social butterfly)\nEnjoy social media\nEnjoy earning money. I’m happy to explain the earning potential across an initial discussion\n   \nWe are offering:\n\nThe chance to work with a fun and social team\nTeam events (quarterly, and regardless of results)\nA great team to learn from\nAwesome Commission Structure\nWork with excellent consultants earning amazing money\n  \nIf you want to know more about working at Just Digital People, have a look at our LinkedIn page or visit our website.
