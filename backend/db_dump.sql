9	1	1	Senior Frontend Engineer (Observability) - Remote Across Anz	Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.\n\nHey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, 你好, hallo, vítejte!\n\nThanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.\n\nWhere and how you can work\n\nOur flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work, we trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.\n\nWhat you’d be doing in this role\n\nAs Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.\n\nAt the moment, this role is focused on:\n\nDelivering features, taking ownership of the entire lifecycle from design doc through to implementation and release.\nHelping deliver monitoring of critical user flows through complete end-to-end tracing.\nHelping identify gaps in Observability tooling at Canva and help take it to the next level.\nBeing proactive in modernising our Observability tooling and participating in brainstorming and POC’ing to determine how we can improve our existing systems.\nBeing proactive and helping improve trace instrumentation on the frontend to surface performance degradation in our frontend components.\nHelping develop solutions to tackle difficult problems such as scaling our platforms to meet Canva's customer growth.\nGuiding and mentoring other people on the team and helping them grow their skills and knowledge.\nYou're probably a match if\n\nYou have experience in TypeScript, which is a must for this role.\nYou have experience in Java or Golang which is a nice to have\nYou have deep knowledge and understanding of Computer Engineering fundamentals and first principles\nYou know Frontend performance metrics and web vitals.\nYou have experience working with and monitoring microservice architectures in large distributed cloud environments (ideally AWS).\nYou have experience with Observability tooling – having proficiency with tools like Grafana, Kibana, Sentry, or similar\nYou have experience with infrastructure-as-code, we’re a Terraform shop, but strong experience with other IaC tools will do the trick\nYou can guide and mentor other members of the team and improve the way we collaborate, learn, and share ideas\nThis role requires a lot of documentation and internal team members’ alignment; therefore strong written and verbal communication skills are required\nNot essential; but helpful experience!\n\nExperience writing native code in Kotlin or Swift since we also maintain the tracing libraries for Android and iOS. \nExperience building custom plugins for Observability data visualisation tools like Kibana, Grafana, etc\nExperience with OpenTelemetry or writing code in Golang since we are adopting OpenTelemetry in a lot of the tooling we provide.\nAbout the team\n\nThe Observability Traces & Exceptions Team is responsible for operational insights inside Canva. Our goal is to provide our development team with world-class tools to view how their services are performing in production. We achieve this by combining industry-leading third-party solutions with our own in-house developed solutions.\n\nWe work across the entire stack maintaining our tracing TypeScript & Java libraries, our tracing infrastructure, error libraries and error handling guidelines to name just a few. As we scale all of these areas, we require more sophisticated solutions to ensure that Canva developers can continue to grow without compromising on reliability or availability.\n\nWhat's in it for you?\n\nAchieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a range of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.\n\nHere's a taste of what's on offer:\n\nEquity packages - we want our success to be yours too\nInclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers\nAn annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more\nFlexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally\nCheck out lifeatcanva.com for more info.\n\nOther stuff to know\n\nWe make hiring decisions based on your experience, skills and passion, as well as how you can enhance Canva and our culture.

3	1	1	Senior Backend Software Engineer - Java - Core Libraries (Remote Across Anz)	Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.\n\nHey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora,你好, hallo, vítejte!\n\nThanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time-consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point. \n\nWhere and how you can work\n\nOur flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you. \n\nAbout the Role\n\nThis role sits within the Core Libraries Team. As a talented senior software engineer, you will be responsible for shaping the vision of libraries, frameworks, and tools used at Canva. We are part of API Platform group and our mission is to empower engineers to build efficient, reliable and secure traffic flow for billions of users.\n\nAt the moment, this role is focused on:\n\nAs an individual contributor, design and implement tools and libraries to improve the reliability of the Canva microservices\n\nConduct and organize reliability experiments to identify possible scenarios in which failures might occur and verify the reliability measures\nDesign and build services and tooling that help ensure each of Canva’s microservices are working optimally and are resilient to failures\nHave a widespread impact across the organization by facilitating and spearheading cross-team initiatives that raise the bar for reliability, velocity and security\nA deep investigation into production incidents followed up by applying the learning to code\nResearching, developing, and justifying the best choices in the form of design docs for features that will shape the future of Canva\nIdentifying and addressing performance bottlenecks within the application and broader infrastructure\nPropose new approaches and solutions to ensure we future-proof Canva’s distributed cloud infrastructure as we scale. Participating in design meetings, hiring interviews, and code reviews\nYou're probably a match if\n\nFive-plus (5+) years of commercial experience developing complex applications in Java; experience with other languages such as Kotlin, TypeScript etc is a big plus but it’s not necessary.\nExtensive experience in developing clean, readable, and maintainable code; The tools developed by the team are used by hundreds of developers at Canva so they need to be easily understandable.\nExperience with developing or maintaining libraries, frameworks or tools would be a big plus but is not necessary.\nFamiliar with asynchronous or reactive programming techniques and associated patterns; At our scale, writing blocking code is often not an option\nComfortable with computer science and engineering fundamentals: concurrency, data structures, and distributed systems\nExperience working in large distributed cloud environments (ideally AWS)\nDisciplined coding practices, experience with code reviews and pull requests, and a creative and conceptual problem-solving approach\nStrong communication and team collaboration skills, both written and verbal. A Canva engineer strives to understand the exact problem before jumping into writing code - look before you leap!\nAn understanding of resiliency techniques and patterns - load balancing, throttling, back pressure, circuit breaking, etc; For Canva, reliability is a feature, and the Core Libraries and broader infrastructure teams aim to provide the best tools possible to the application engineers to ensure that Canva stays available at all times.\nAbout the Group\n\nThe Core Libraries team is responsible for developing and maintaining internal libraries and tools utilized by Canva's development teams. We are currently facing exciting challenges to uplift platform capabilities to prepare Canva for 1 Billion monthly active users in 2026.\n\nWhat's in it for you?\n\nAchieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a stack of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.\n\nHere's a taste of what's on offer:\n\nEquity packages - we want our success to be yours too\nInclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers\nAn annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more\nFlexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally\nCheck out lifeatcanva.com for more info.\n\nOther stuff to know\n\nWe make hiring decisions based on your experience, skills and passion, as well as how you can enhance Canva and our culture. When you apply, please tell us the pronouns you use and any reasonable adjustments you may need during the interview process. \n\nPlease note that interviews are conducted virtually.
